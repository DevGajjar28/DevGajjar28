## ⚡ Yo, I’m Dev

I'm currently in my final year of MScIT and I love building things that are useful and scalable.  
One of my key projects is a **production-level SaaS(https://coldreach.in)** that automates cold outreach for freshers and students looking for jobs and internships fully built by me from scratch.

I'm actively exploring opportunities in **Frontend**, **Full Stack**, **Software Engineering**, and **DevOps** roles.


### 💻 Tech Stack:
- HTML (yeah, the real OG)
- CSS / Tailwind (don’t @ me, I love utility classes)
- JavaScript / React / Next.js (my daily fuel)
- Node.js / MongoDB (backend, but make it snappy)
- SQL (I can join more than just tables 😉)
- Java / C / C++ (academia made me, not mad about it)
- Python

### ⚙️ Currently Juggling
- Learning **React Native** mobile is the next frontier 🚀
- Scaling up my SaaS
- DevOps

### 🚀 My SaaS – ColdReach

> Built for students. Used by students.  
> It auto-sends smart, personalized emails to HRs for jobs & internships.  
> Think of it like your placement buddy who *never sleeps*.

Stack: `React` + `Node` + `Mongo` + `Tailwind` + `Cloudinary`  
No templates. No fluff. Just results.
